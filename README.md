## Bird Spotting With Raspberry Pi and Amazon Rekognition

## Description
This project uses a Raspberry pi complete with a camera and motion sensor to identify birds. The device can be placed near where you would expect to see birds (backyard, bird feeder, etc.)

## What You Will Need
- Raspberry Pi (any model)
- Raspberry Pi camera (Arducam is a cheaper alternative that works just as well)
- PIR motion sensor
- USB Wifi dongle (if not built in to your Pi model)
- Power supply for Raspberry Pi
- LED diode (optional)
- 5 male female jumper wires
- 1 100ohm resistor
